  <h2>Grow Together</h2>

  Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal community.
  Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on with a feedback form.

  <h2>Flowing Conversations</h2>

  You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads
  have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.

  <h2>Your Users</h2>

  It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution.
  This means, once signed in to your app, your users can start chatting immediately.
